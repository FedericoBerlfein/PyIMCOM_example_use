Setting up the simualated data can be a bit challenging at first. Especially if you have never worked with OU24 before. 

To download the data you can go to the documentation of OU24. If you only want the preview data they can be accessed here: https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/theory/openuniverse2024/roman/

Then you want to download /RomanWAS/images/simple_model folder. What I did was I created a folder called "RomanWAS/images" in my directory and then downloaded the "simple_model" folder into the images directory. This avoids downloading a bunch of data you might not need. If you only want to use the exposures for the wide area, there is a txt file here called "wide-survey-list.txt" containing the exposures in the wide survey. Then for running IMCOM, what I did was create a separate directory in RomanWAS called images_wide, and put symlinks in there to the correspinding observations in the images directory that are only in wide. This avoids duplicating data. The script make_symlinks.py in the scripts folder has the code I used to do this. I had to run it for the H158 and J129 images separetly.

Once this is done and you have to run the batch_genpsf code to generate the input PSFs. The output of running this code should go to the psf folder.
If you have slurm in your HPC, you can simply run:

sbatch batch_genpsf.sh
or if you don't, you can simply run the python file:
python batch_genpsf.py

The code is parallelized so it should be pretty fast. But get the data before running batch_genpsf, as this code will generate the PSF for the observations in a given directory of images, so you first need to have the images. This is only because of my implementation, in theory you could just have a different implementation where it reads the observations you want to create the input PSF from a txt file or something like that.
